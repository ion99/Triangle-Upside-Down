# Triangle-Upside-Down

Let’s print a triangle made of asterisks (‘*’) separated by spaces and consisting of n rows upside down, and make it symmetrical. Consecutive rows should contain 2n − 1, 2n − 3, . . . , 3, 1 asterisks and should be indented by 0, 2, 4, . . . , 2(n − 1) spaces. For example, for n = 4 the triangle should appear as follows:


* * * * * * *

  * * * * *

    * * *
    
      *

The triangle should have n rows, where n is some given positive integer.
